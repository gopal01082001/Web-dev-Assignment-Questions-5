// Q.2 What are Web Apis ?
// Web APIs, also known as Application Programming Interfaces, are a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the internet. They provide a way for applications to request and exchange data or functionality with other systems, services, or platforms.

// Web APIs are primarily used in web development to enable integration between different applications, allowing developers to access and use functionalities or data from external sources. These APIs define a standardized format for requesting and exchanging information, typically using the HTTP protocol.

// Web APIs can serve different purposes, including:

// Retrieving data: Web APIs can be used to retrieve data from external sources such as databases, content management systems, social media platforms, or weather services. Developers can make HTTP requests to specific API endpoints to retrieve the desired data in a structured format, such as JSON or XML.

// Sending data: APIs also allow applications to send data to external systems. This can be useful for performing actions like submitting forms, creating or updating records, or posting content to social media platforms.

// Integrating services: Web APIs enable the integration of different services and systems. For example, an e-commerce website may use payment gateway APIs to process online transactions, or a mapping application may use a geolocation API to display maps and location data.

// Extending functionality: APIs can be used to extend the functionality of an application by allowing developers to incorporate external services or features. For instance, developers can integrate third-party authentication services, messaging platforms, or data analysis tools into their applications using the respective APIs.

// Web APIs are typically documented with detailed specifications, including the available endpoints, request parameters, response formats, authentication methods, and any limitations or usage quotas. This documentation helps developers understand how to interact with the API and integrate it into their applications effectively.

// Popular examples of web APIs include the Google Maps API, Twitter API, Facebook Graph API, and many others.
